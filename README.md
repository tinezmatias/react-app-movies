# Getting Started with React App Movie

![Poster Img](https://github.com/tinezmatias/react-app-movies/blob/main/docs/img/poster.png?raw=true)

This project is the result of an interview challenge.
you can read the details of the requested challenge [here](./docs/challenge.md).

You will notice that I don't use any component libraries, for a particular reason, I think the idea of a challenge is to demonstrate as much knowledge as possible.
The next known steps could be any of the [nice to have](./docs/nice-to-have.md), or create other versions of this same project using libraries like materialui or baseweb.

## How to develop

Prerequisites:

1. have an api key from 'themoviedb', if you don't have it you can follow these steps.
1. create an .env file, copy everything from .env.example, and complete with your api key.
1. have node version 16.x, if you have nvm you can run nvm use to solve this.
1. install dependencies, you can run yarn install.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
